    <p>
        Choose your preferred value for the tax rate. The median of all the selected taxes is going to be chosen.
        <b>Example:</b> Suppose you have chosen a tax rate
        of 0.5. The other 8 members of your group have chosen: 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 0.2, 0.5, 0.4, 0.9, 0.2. Sorted from low
        to high we have <br>
        1: 0.1<br>
        2: 0.2<br>
        3: 0.2<br>
        4: 0.4<br>
        <b>5: 0.4 (= median tax)</b><br>
        6: 0.5<br>
        7: 0.5<br>
        8: 0.8<br>
        9: 0.9
    </p>
    <p>
        The median in the example would be 0.4. Therefore, this is the tax rate that is going to be applied to the income
        of the whole group.

        Remember that the amount spend on sending the messages is going to be taken from your income after taxes.
